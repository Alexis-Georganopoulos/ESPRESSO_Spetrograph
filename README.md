# Consoslidating data from the ESSPRESO sprectrograph
The search for exoplanets in astronomy requires especially precise equipment and measurement. Over stellar distances, the smallest errors can propagate into vastly different measurements. <br>
As such, great care must be taken at every step of the process. In the results of this thesis, we focus on how two specific processes affect the *radial speed* of planetary measurement. We look into the spurious effects of a Fabry-Perrot interferometer, and the effect of optical fibre geometry/material properties on wavelengths of Echelle-grated light.

## Spurious effects on a Fabry-Perot interferometer
   
Thank you for letting me know! In that case, I can provide a more detailed summary of the Python code in the following link: https://github.com/Alexis-Georganopoulos/Masters-Thesis/blob/main/filter-analysis/fabry-perrot-toy.py

The code is part of a project aimed at testing how different filters interfere with the 'ideal' output of a Fabry-Perot interferometer. A Fabry-Perot interferometer is an optical device used for measuring wavelengths of light, where it consists of two mirrors that form a resonant cavity. When light is incident on the mirrors, it is reflected back and forth, causing interference between the incident and reflected waves. By analysing the interference pattern, the wavelength of the light can be determined.

The code in the link simulates the interference pattern generated by the Fabry-Perot interferometer with different filters. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. The user is then prompted to input various parameters such as the distance between the mirrors, the wavelength of the incident light, and the refractive indices of the filters.

The program then proceeds to generate the transfer functions of the filters using the provided refractive indices. Transfer functions describe how a filter affects a signal in the frequency domain, and they are computed using the Fourier transform. The transfer functions are then multiplied by the Fourier transform of the incident light to obtain the Fourier transform of the light that passes through the filters.

The program then calculates the complex reflectivity of the Fabry-Perot mirrors using the provided parameters. The complex reflectivity describes how the mirrors reflect light at different wavelengths and angles. The program then multiplies the Fourier transform of the incident light by the complex reflectivity to obtain the Fourier transform of the light reflected by the mirrors.

Finally, the program uses the Fourier transforms of the light transmitted by the filters and the light reflected by the mirrors to obtain the interference pattern generated by the Fabry-Perot interferometer. The program then plots the interference pattern using Matplotlib.

In summary, the Python code simulates the interference pattern generated by a Fabry-Perot interferometer with different filters. The program uses various numerical techniques, such as Fourier transforms and complex reflectivity calculations, to generate the interference pattern. The resulting plots provide insight into how different filters affect the ideal output of the Fabry-Perot interferometer.
